father;Father;Finally, a vacation from the dull office with my loving daughter, quality time with the kids and all! Right?
daughter;Daughter;Yay...
father;Father;Oh put some spirit into it! Nothing like the refreshing feel of space on your hull, I always say.
daughter;Daughter;You never say that.
father;Father;Well I will from now on! Anyway, your brother and Martha can do just fine without us for a minute, can't they?
daughter;Daughter;I do not believe myself qualified to answer that, dad.
father;Father;Well ya know what? Just to make it easy on them, let's take a shortcut! C'mon, this will be fun!
