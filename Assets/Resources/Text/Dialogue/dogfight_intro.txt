police;POLICE MAN;Sir, this is a secure area, housing asteroids of historical significance. You are not allowed to perform demolition here.
father;Father;What?! There is nothing historically significant about asteroids! These rocks are worthless!
police;POLICE MAN;I don't make the rules, sir. The law states you are not allowed scavenging in this area, please proceed elsewhere.
father;Father;But my sick Patty!.. These blasted rocks hide minerals that might aid in her fight with the virus! I read about these things... Does the life of a child mean nothing to you?!...
police;POLICE MAN;What child?.. Sir, a civilian database scan tells us that you have never had any children...
father;Father?;My daughter, Patty Wallflower! How is this possible! My flesh and blood!
police;POLICE MAN;Sir, I do not have a record of anybody named Patty Wallflower living anywhere near your home sector. According to our records, you are Jared Turnip, no known priors or family... Your uncle owns the small rock demolition business in your home sector and the SIN number on your vessel matches one of those registered to his company. This making sense so far, Mr. Turnip?
father;J.Turnip;The bit about this ship does appear to be the case, yes...
police;POLICE MAN;This is where you lose me, Mr. Turnip. The record does not show you ever fathering a Patty Wallflower or even a Patty Turnip of any kind. Nor have you ever been wed or fathered the children of any known Mrs. Wallflower in your area. Mind explaining this?
father;J.Turnip;Is this how far the corrupt goverment has fallen... You would dare deny my precious Patty's very EXISTENCE!?... For a few old rocks?!... I am not backing down from this! My daughter needs a cure and I don't want to have to get dangerous to get it!
police;POLICE MAN;Sir, please don't resist arrest... Take it up with the civilian registration offices... *sigh*... Never see people at their best, with this job...
