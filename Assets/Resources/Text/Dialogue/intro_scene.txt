father;Father;Father's Log, entry 985...
father;Father;If you are listening to this, then I have failed in my mission. the following is provided to sate the morbid curiosity of those interested in reasons behind my reckless trajectory...
father;Father;My precious Patty...
father;Father;It has been 5 days, 4 hours and 32 minutes since my poor girl was diagnosed with IPV. I now know that I had no idea of the nature of true misery before this juncture. 
father;Father;Naturally, I couldn't take the nervewracking wait for a treatment that never came any longer and took matters into my own hands. I have heard of a rare mineral mined in far off asteroids, just recently used in experimental treatments for this sort of thing!
father;Father;The doctor's say we cant take risks. That there are no shortcuts when it comes to proper rehabilitation from something like this...
father;Father;Well I'm not a doctor and I've got an asteroid mining vessel to prove it! I wont let some illness shortcut my family!
