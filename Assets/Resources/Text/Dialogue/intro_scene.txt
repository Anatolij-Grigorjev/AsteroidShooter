father;Father;Father's Log, entry 985...
father;Father;Today i begin my journey into the dark abyss, putting the fate of my family into a bunch of floating rocks.
father;Father;Oh Patty...
father;Father;It has been 5 days, 4 hours and 32 minutes since my poor girl was diagnosed with that blasted virus. It pained me, threw my emotions in the grinder and I wasnt too proud of what came out the other end. 
father;Father;This was not a fixable problem, so the doctors said. 
father;Father;But I couldn't sit back and do nothing! 3 days into the struggle, I read about minerals that were rapidly changing the scene of modern medicine. I read they gravitate towards asteroids and become appearant once the rocks are cleared away.
father;Father;The doctor's wanted to hear none of this. They say those minerals are probably a hoax and all too new and risky if they aren't. "There are no shortcuts when it comes to proper treatment", they said...
father;Father;Well I'm not a doctor, but my family has been in the asteroid demolition business for a while now! I wasn't about to let some virus dictate shortcuts to my family!
